				After completing our due diligence at the largest and one of the busiest
				Ruth’s Chris in the U.S., our group has rolled out Frylow in all our
				locations. These are the results we got from Frylow:
				<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <b>Better tasting product</b>
				<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• 10-20% reduced cook time
				<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• 10F reduced oil temps
				<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <b>More evenly cooked product</b> with no burning
				tips or fragment
				<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•{' '}
				<b>
					We typically changed our oil every 3-4 days and now go 10-12 days.
				</b>
				<br />I don’t need to tell you the savings this brings to the table on
				overall cost and oil.

				Apple Core has been extremely satisfied with the Frylow bricks. We have
				had them in place for almost 2 years now. 
				<b> We have decreased our fryer shortening by 50% from day 1</b> and
				have maintained that same ratio. With our <b>23 locations</b> we had a
				savings of 1,094 tubs of oil the first month and have maintained that
				each month since. That is a savings of $1,284.26 per location per month.
				<br />
				<br />
				<b>Our ROI on Frylow was 3-4 months.</b> The bonus is with the Frylow
				bricks we were able to turn down our fry temp by about 6 degrees.{' '}
				<b>
					Apple Core is still saving $1,200 per month per location two years
					later
				</b>{' '}
				it’s almost like printing money.

				Recently we had the opportunity to test Frylow in all seven of our
				fryers at our Goodyear location. With the high volume of food that is
				fried in our restaurant, we are normally changing the oil every other
				day. With the Frylow added to all of our systems we noticed that we only
				needed to change the oil every 4 to 5 days.{' '}
				<b>This is a significant decrease in oil usage on average of 50%.</b> We
				also needed to reduce the temperature and re-calibrate all of our fryers
				to 335 degrees from 350 degrees thus <b>using less energy.</b>
				<br />
				<br />
				Additionally we noticed that the food took less time than our
				specification cook times which increased speed of service from the
				kitchen as well as{' '}
				<b>
					decreased labor needed since we were changing oil less frequently. The
					product tasted better and came out more quickly.
				</b>{' '}
				I definitely recommend Frylow to any restaurant that uses deep fryers.
				The cost savings will be evident.

				We have here at Carnival UK introduced the Frylow units to both P&O
				Cruises & Cunard in 2013 and we are very pleased with the results we are
				achieving thus far.
				<br />
				We installed the units in all UK ships and have{' '}
				<b>achieved an ROI of less than 10 months</b>, all while{' '}
				<b>serving better quality food, reducing carbon foot </b> prints and
				backed with a 5 year warranty. The units are <b>easy to use</b>, well
				received by our on board teams and have a great back up after sales
				service. I would recommend Frylow to anyone interested in achieving the
				above benefits.

				Recently, we installed the Frylow Technology in our most popular
				restaurant, The Cactus Grill, to see how it would work. Our entire staff
				was <b>amazed by its performance.</b> In that one restaurant alone,{' '}
				<b>we will be saving over $4,500 a year on frying oil</b> we will be{' '}
				<b>saving on our labor costs</b> by changing the oil half as often, we
				will be reducing our impact on the environment by 50%, and the risk, to
				our mostly student-employees, for an injury or mishap with the hot oil
				during the change-out just got cut in half also.
