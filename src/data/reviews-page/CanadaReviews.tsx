				Apple Core has been extremely satisfied with the Frylow bricks. We have

				each month since. That is a savings of $1,284.26 per location per month.
				<br />
				<br />
				<b>Our ROI on Frylow was 3-4 months.</b> The bonus is with the Frylow

				Recently we had the opportunity to test Frylow in all seven of our
				fryers at our Goodyear location. With the high volume of food that is
				fried in our restaurant, we are normally changing the oil every other
				day. With the Frylow added to all of our systems we noticed that we only
				needed to change the oil every 4 to 5 days.{' '}
				<b>This is a significant decrease in oil usage on average of 50%.</b> We
				also needed to reduce the temperature and re-calibrate all of our fryers
				to 335 degrees from 350 degrees thus <b>using less energy.</b>
				<br />
				<br />
				Additionally we noticed that the food took less time than our
				specification cook times which increased speed of service from the
				kitchen as well as{' '}
				<b>
					decreased labor needed since we were changing oil less frequently. The
					product tasted better and came out more quickly.
				</b>{' '}
				I definitely recommend Frylow to any restaurant that uses deep fryers.
				The cost savings will be evident.

				Kelly O’ Bryan’s & Carlos O’ Bryan’s Chain of Restaurants decided to use

				Prices of fryer oil were on a steady increase and we tested Frylow for a

				<b>
					Frylow is easy to use, very low maintenance and the results were

				were able to move to a lower cost fryer oil.
				<br /> Quality of our products in the deep fryers increased as well. The
				Frylow system actually cooks the items in oil without saturating the
				food product with oil, it repels the oil so that items are cooked more
				evenly, less greasy, and retains the natural juice in our chicken, rib
				products.
				<br /> In over a year we saved money, increased quality, we have never
				had to repair or replace any of our Frylow units, this system is very
				simple and we are still going strong. I highly recommend it.
