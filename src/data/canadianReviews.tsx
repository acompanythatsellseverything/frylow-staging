				Kelly O'Bryan's & Carlos O'Bryan's Chain of Restaurants decided to use
				the Frylow systems in our busy high volume deep fryers over a year ago.
				Prices of fryer oil were on a steady increase and we tested Frylow for a
				month in one of our locations and quickly saw the results.{' '}
				<b>
					Frylow is easy to use, very low maintenance and the results were
					amazing.
				</b>{' '}
				Not only did <b>it save us almost 50% on our oil consumption</b>, we
				were able to move to a lower cost fryer oil.
				<br />
				<b>Quality of our products</b> in the deep fryers{' '}
				<b>increased as well</b>. The Frylow system actually cooks the items in
				oil without saturating the food product with oil, it repels the oil so
				that <b>items are cooked more evenly, less greasy,</b> and retains the
				natural juice in our chicken, rib products.
				<br /> In over a year we <b>saved money, increased quality,</b> we have
				never had to repair or replace any of our Frylow units, this{' '}
				<b>system is very simple</b> and we are still going strong. I highly
				recommend it.

				Apple Core has been extremely satisfied with the Frylow bricks. We have
				had them in place for almost 2 years now.
				<b> We have decreased our fryer shortening by 50% from day 1</b> and
				have maintained that same ratio. With our 23 locations we had a savings
				of 1,094 tubs of oil the first month and have maintained that each month
				since. That is a savings of $1,284.26 per location per month.
				<br />
				<br />
				<b>Our ROI on Frylow was 3-4 months.</b> The bonus is with the Frylow
				bricks we were able to turn down our fry temp by about 6 degrees.{' '}
				<b>
					Apple Core is still saving $1,200 per month per location two years
					later
				</b>{' '}
				it’s almost like printing money.

				Recently we had the opportunity to test Frylow in all seven of our
				fryers at our Goodyear location. With the high volume of food that is
				fried in our restaurant, we are normally changing the oil every other
				day. With the Frylow added to all of our systems we noticed that we only
				needed to change the oil every 4 to 5 days.{' '}
				<b>This is a significant decrease in oil usage on average of 50%.</b> We
				also needed to reduce the temperature and re-calibrate all of our fryers
				to 335 degrees from 350 degrees thus <b>using less energy.</b>
				<br />
				<br />
				Additionally we noticed that the food took less time than our
				specification cook times which increased speed of service from the
				kitchen as well as{' '}
				<b>
					decreased labor needed since we were changing oil less frequently. The
					product tasted better and came out more quickly.
				</b>{' '}
				I definitely recommend Frylow to any restaurant that uses deep fryers.
				The cost savings will be evident.

				We have here at Carnival UK introduced the Frylow units to both P&O
				Cruises & Cunard in 2013 and we are very pleased with the results we are
				achieving thus far.
				<br />
				We installed the units in all UK ships and have{' '}
				<b>achieved an ROI of less than 10 months</b>, all while{' '}
				<b>serving better quality food, reducing carbon foot </b> prints and
				backed with a 5 year warranty. The units are <b>easy to use</b>, well
				received by our on board teams and have a great back up after sales
				service. I would recommend Frylow to anyone interested in achieving the
				above benefits.

				We have tested the “Frylow” in our <b>corporate store</b> for two months
				and were very pleased with the results. This attachment{' '}
				<b>extended the life of our shortening by almost double</b>, and we have
				now recommended this product to our Franchisees. Several locations have
				subsequently purchased these units. We have been told that these units
				typically last 5-7 years. With the immediate savings we have
				experienced, it is projected that these attachments will pay for
				themselves within 6 months. This would leave several years of
				“incremental profit.” We would not hesitate to recommend this product to
				anyone who uses a deep fryer.
